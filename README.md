# Light and Shite
Simple CSS for your site. Keep expectations low. :shit: 

A simple CSS style with features I found lacking in other lightweight CSS stylesheets

## Features

* Clear, readible text
* Simple and minimal
* Responsive text and images
* Nav bar
* Footer
* Easy to extend and customise

Download it from the [Github repo](https://github.com/alexjj/light-and-shite/releases/latest)
and link it in your html head `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.min.css">`.
